# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Password Generator (React): Developed a robust and user-friendly password generator application using React. Implemented key features allowing users to customize password length and include numbers and special characters. Utilized React hooks for efficient state management and side effects, and ensured a responsive design with a modern UI using TailwindCSS. Incorporated a copy-to-clipboard feature for convenience, enhancing user experience. This project demonstrates proficiency in JavaScript, React, and responsive web design, as well as an understanding of secure clipboard operations.
